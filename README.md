Additional material for video Qspice #2: Digital PWM and Signal Sampling

Available at: https://youtu.be/vJ8m6s4OE1I

This video shows how to implement in a Qspice C++ module two basic functions used in digital control. First, how to generate a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal, which can be used to drive the switch of a power converter. Second, how to do the sampling of an analog signal, which can be employed to measure the variables of interests in power converters, for example the output voltage or current. Qspice simulations are shown to illustrate the process. Finally, a Qspice simulation is used to show how to employ these techniques on a buck dc-dc converter.
